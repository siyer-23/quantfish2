## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
data(murders)
murders %>%
  ggplot(aes(population, total, label = abb, color = region)) + geom_label()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(murders)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

**Notes:**
to install a package for the first time, the code is install.packages("package_name")

you can also install multiple at once by doing install.packages(c("package1", "package2"))

to see all installed packages, run installed.packages()
from then on, you can load it into your script/markdown file with library(package)

to run an entire script, press control + shift + enter
to run one line of code, press control + enter

I'm not entirely sure how the murders %>% geom section works. maybe there will be something explaining this in the DataCamp tutorial once I can access more of it? 


Objects:
objects can be variables or more complex things like functions
  storing variables:
```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 1
c <- -1
```
  printing variables:
```{r}
a
print(a)
```
  When objects are defined in the console, the workspace is changed.
  See all objects defined in the workspace:
```{r}
ls()
```
  quadratic formula example:
```{r}
(-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/(2*a)
(-b - sqrt(b^2 - 4*a*c))/(2*a)
```

Functions:
  
  to evaluate a function, put parentheses at the end. if you don't add the parentheses, it shows you the code for the function.
  
  the argument of a function goes in between the parentheses. for a function like log() which takes the log of the argument, the argument can be a number or a variable that represents a number.
  
  there can also be nested functions. you can use a function to get the argument for another function.
  example:
```{r}
exp(1)
log(2.718)
log(exp(1))
```
  IMPORTANT: functions are evaluated from the inside out. Above, exp happens before log.
  
  to get help (aka a user manual) on a function: help("function_name")
  this will tell you what arguments it expects. If there is a default for an argument, it will be defined here using an =
  
  to get just the arguments and less other info, use args(function_name)
```{r}
args(log)
```
  this shows that you have to input a number to take the log of, and you can set a base if it isn't e. 
  example:
```{r}
log(8, base = 2)
log(x = 8, base = 2)
```
arithmetic and relational functions don't need arguments.  

to see built in datasets:
```{r}
data()
```


Variable names:
  must start with a letter, can't contain spaces
  avoid using variable names that are the same as built in ones
  use _ instead of spaces
